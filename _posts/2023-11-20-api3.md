## Caching

- Caching is a technique of serving saved results instead of creating a fresh one every time it is requested

- Caching can be implemented at various levels : Reverse Proxy Server , Web Server , Database

## Layered Architecture

1. Visitor

    The client or User accessing the DRF, and initiates a request to interact with the API and retrieve or manipulate data

2. Firewall

    Act as a security layer, protecting the DRF from unauthorized access and potentical threats

3. Reverse Proxy Server

    It serves as an `intermediary` between the client and the web server. It receives requests from the client and distributes them to the appropriate web server based on factors (load balancing, caching)

4. Web Server

    Handling HTTP requests from the client and generating responses. It processes the incoming request, and retrieves or manipulates data from the database servers

5. Database Server

    The database servers store and manage the data needed for the DRF. Handle storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations based on the requests received from the web server
